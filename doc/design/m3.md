# M3 backup/restore mechanics #

We assume the files are append-only; once we have hardlinked
file hierarchy at some point, the files should stay constant (and at worst
just grow a bit).

## M3 backup

Therefore, the M3 backup is pretty simple:

- take snapshot of etcd key prefixes covered by our m3 support

- (on each node) snapshot

    - make hardlinks to separate directory hierarchy, and note down file
      attributes such as size and mtime ( ~ fast)

    - calculate hex digests for files which have changed since the previous
      snapshot ( ~ slow first time, but subsequent attempts should be
      reasonably fast ); only use up to recorded size bytes

- list hex digests in object storage

- (on each node) upload missing hex digests to object storage

- take another snapshot of etcd key prefixes - if they are not same, fail
  the backup attempt (and retry immediately)

- create backup manifest and upload it to object storage


## M3 restore

The restoration's only complex part is matching the AZs so that we do not
have unbalanced cluster. Beyond that,

- (on each node) download the files from object storage directly into place

- restore etcd prefixes - for each prefix,

    - delete the whole prefix from etcd

    - put (individually) the entries from backup

        - some entries are rewritten to contain new node information if and
          when the nodes are not quite the same as the original ones
