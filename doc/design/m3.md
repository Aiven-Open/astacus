# M3 backup/restore mechanics #

We assume the files are append-only; therefore, once we have hardlinked
hierarchy at some point, the files should stay constant (and at worst just
grow a bit) after the snapshot.

## M3 backup

Therefore, the M3 backup is pretty simple:

- take snapshot of etcd key prefixes covered by our m3 support

- snapshot each node (= make hardlinks to separate directory ~fast, and
  then calculate hexdigests for changed files slowly)

- upload missing hexdigests to object storage

- take another snanshot of etcd key profixes - if they are not same, fail
  the backup (and retry ~immediately)

- create backup manifest and upload it to object storage


## M3 restore

The restoration's only complex part is matching the AZs so that we do not
have unbalanced cluster. Beyond that,

- we simply restore files in place
- we restore etcd prefixes - for each prefix,
  - delete the whole prefix from etcd
  - put (individually) the entries from backup
